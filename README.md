Microsoft coding comp hosted at MSU
We had 3 hours to complete as many point valued challenges as we could from a list of 8 challenges. Three were worth a single point, three were worth two points and two were worth three points. I finished four challenges for a total of six points. The code snippetts provide a great look into my mindset during a coding competition as well as the sort of sprint style of coding I employ. I think I'll leave the solutions and repo raw as this is more reflexive of what was going through my mind during the challenge.
